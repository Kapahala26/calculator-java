Informal Review of the Code:

- General Observations ->
The code is a basic calculator implementation that parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.
It uses nested classes and static methods to perform operations.
The code handles basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Positive Aspects ->
Modular Design: The code is divided into methods (evaluateExpression and Calculate), which makes it easier to understand and maintain.
Use of Constants: The arithmetic operation symbols are defined as constants in the Operations class, which improves readability and maintainability.
Error Handling: The code includes error handling for parsing numbers, returning "ERROR" if parsing fails.
- Specific Suggestions ->
Refactor Calculate Method: Reduce code duplication by creating helper methods for each operation.
Improve Naming Conventions: Rename ToString to toString.
Use Constants for Magic Numbers: Define a constant for 0 used in the expression expression = 0 + expression;.
Add More Comments: Add comments to explain the purpose and logic of each method and block of code.
